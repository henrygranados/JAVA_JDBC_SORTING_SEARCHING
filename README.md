JAVA_JDBC_SORTING_SEARCHING
========================

I created an embedded database with one table (people)  where I have stored people's 
first_name, last_name and age.
I was able to retrieve all of the people's records from the database using JDBC driver for MySQL.
This program sorts people's information by their last name. 
It also allows the user to enter the customer's name and lastName so it can be found by 
using the Scanner class and some other built-in methods.
 

The main goal of this program is to show a good understanding of classes, Objects, Lists, Interfaces , Exception,
data handling coming from MySql DataBase using JDBC, etc.

Sincerely,

Henry Granados.
