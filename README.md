JAVA_JDBC_SORTING_SEARCHING
========================

1.- I created an embedded database with one table (people)  where I have stored people's 
first_name, last_name and age.
2.- I was able to retrieve all of the people's records from the database using JDBC driver for MySQL.
3.- This program also sorts people's information by their last name. 

The main goal of this program was to show a good understanding of classes, Objects, Lists, Interfaces , Exception,
data handling coming from MySql DataBase, etc.
